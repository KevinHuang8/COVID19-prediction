1.tgz is air quality data from January, 2.tgz is from February, etc.

Files are in the format HourlyAQObs_{year}{month}{day}{hour}.dat and contain air quality information from 7AM to 10PM inclusive (working hours). Month, Day, and Hour are all 0 padded to 2 digits. The actual air quality metric is derived from https://docs.airnowapi.org/docs/HourlyDataFactSheet.pdf, which you can use to derive relationships about traffic patterns, etc. from pollution levels. If you want more detailed air quality data, beyond what I was able to pull (due to the limitations github places on file sizes), airnow.gov (https://docs.airnowapi.org/files) has more data files.

At each day, data from the current day (up to the current hour before) will be pulled in, and placed in the corresponding tar file for its month. For example, on April 5th, data for April 4th will be pulled in, and 4.tgz will be updated. Files will not be overwritten, so you should be fine extracting over existing files.
