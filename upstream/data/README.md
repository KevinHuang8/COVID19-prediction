# `data`

This directory contains both US data (mostly at the county level) and international data. Detailed information on each of the datasets is provided both in the README files of `international` and `us`..


## Getting started with U.S. data

For the most curated dataset of COVID-19 cases, see `covid/nyt_us_counties.csv`. Additional variables can be merged in from the appropriate subdirectories, and we also provide useful aggregate datasets of relevant variables (demographics, health, etc.) in `aggregate_berkeley.csv` and `aggregate_jhu.csv`.

## Getting started with international data
If you are beginning international data analysis, an excellent place to start is `aggregated_our_world_in_data.csv`, which includes COVID-19 data per country and helpful related variables (demographics, health, etc.) all cleaned and organized with ISO variables.
If you are beginning a case study of a country that faced the pandemic earlier than the U.S., a good place to start is `italy/covid-regions.csv` for region-level COVID-19 data and `italy/aggregate_italy.csv` for related demographic, economic, and health variables.
